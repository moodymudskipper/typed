*{typed}* implements a type system for R, it has 3 main features:

* set variable types in a script or the body of a function, so they can't be
  assigned illegal values
* set argument types in a function definition
* set return type of a function

The user can define their own types, or leverage assertions from
other packages.

Under the hood variable types use active bindings, so once a variable is restricted
by an assertion, it cannot be modified in a way that would
not satisfy it.

## Installation

Install CRAN version with:

``` r
install.packages("typed")
```

or development version with :

``` r
remotes::install_github("moodymudskipper/typed")
```

And attach with : 

```{r}
# masking warning about overriding `?`
library(typed, warn.conflicts = FALSE) 
```

## Set variable type

### Question mark notation and `declare`

Here are examples on how we would set types 

```{r}
Character() ? x # restrict x to "character" type
x <- "a"
x

Integer(3) ? y <- 1:3 # restrict y to "integer" type of length 3
y
```

We cannot assign values of the wrong type to `x` and `y` anymore.

```{r}
x <- 2

y <- 4:5
```

But the right type will work.

```{r}
x <- c("b", "c")

y <- c(1L, 10L, 100L)
```

`declare` is a strict equivalent, slightly more efficient, which looks like `base::assign`.

```{r}
declare("x", Character())
x <- "a"
x

declare("y", Integer(3), 1:3)
y
```

### Assertion factories and assertions

`Integer` and `Character` are function factories (functions that return functions),
thus `Integer(3)` and `Character()` are functions.

The latter functions operate checks on a value and in case of success 
return this value, generally unmodified. For instance :

```{r}
Integer(3)(1:2)

Character()(3)
```

We call `Integer(3)` and `Character()` assertions, and we call
`Integer` and `Character` assertion factories.

The package contains many assertion factories (see `?assertion_factories`), 
the main ones are: 

* `Any` (No default restriction)
* `Logical`
* `Integer`
* `Double`
* `Character`
* `List`
* `Environment`
* `Factor`
* `Matrix`
* `Data.frame`
* `Date`
* `Time` (POSIXct)

### Custom assertions

As we've seen with `Integer(3)`, passing arguments to a
assertion factory restricts the type.

For instance `Integer` has arguments `length` `null_ok` and
`...`, we already used `length`, `null_ok` is convenient to allow a default `NULL`
value in addition to the `"integer"` type.
In the dots we can use arguments named as functions and with the value of
the expected result.

```{r}
Integer(anyNA = FALSE) ? x <- c(1L, 2L, NA)
```

Useful arguments might be for instance, `anyDuplicated = 0L`, `names = NULL`, 
`attributes = NULL`... Any available function can be used.

That makes assertion factories very flexible! If it is still not flexible enough, one
can provide conditions using formulas in the `...`.
Be careful to skip all named arguments by adding comas, or name the formula arguments
`...`.

```{r}
fruit <- Character(1, ... = "`value` is not a fruit!" ~ . %in% c("apple", "pear", "cherry"))

fruit ? x <- "potatoe"
```

The arguments can differ between assertion factories, for instance `Data.frame`
has `nrow`, `ncol`, `each`, `null_ok` and `...`

```{r}
Data.frame() ? x <- iris
Data.frame(ncol = 2) ? x <- iris
Data.frame(each = Double()) ? x <- iris
```

### Leverage assertions from other packages, build your own assertion factories

Some great packages provide assertions, and they can be used with `typed`
provided that they take the object as a first input and return the object
if no failure. Richie Cotton's *{assertive}* and Michel Lang's *{checkmate}* 
both qualify.

```{r}
library(assertive)
assert_is_monotonic_increasing ? z
z <- 3:1
```

If we want to use more than the first argument, we should create an assertion factory :

```{r}
Monotonic_incr <- as_assertion_factory(assert_is_monotonic_increasing)
Monotonic_incr(strictly = TRUE) ? z
z <- c(1, 1, 2)
```

`as_assertion_factory` can be used to create your own assertion factories from scratch too,
in fact
[it's used to build the native assertion factories of this package](https://github.com/moodymudskipper/typed/blob/master/R/06_native_types.R)
.

### Constants

To define a constant, we just surround the variable by parentheses (think of 
them as a protection)

```{r}
Double() ? (x) <- 1
x <- 2

? (y) <- 1
y <- 2
```

## Set argument type

We can set argument types this way : 


```{r}
add <- ? function (x= ? Double(), y= 1 ? Double()) {
  x + y
}
```

Note that we started the definition with a `?`, and that we gave a default to
`y`, but not `x`. Note also the `=` sign next to `x`, necessary even when we
have no default value. If you forget it you'll have an error "unexpected `?` in ...".

This created the following function, by adding checks at the top of the
body

```{r}
add
```

Let's test it by providing a right and wrong type.

```{r}
add(2, 3)
add(2, 3L)
```


If we want to restrict `x` and `y`  to the type "integer" in the rest of
the body of the function we can use the `?+` notation :

```{r}
add <- ? function (x= ?+ Double(), y= 1 ?+ Double()) {
  x + y
}

add
```

We see that it is translated into a `check_arg` call containing a `.bind = TRUE`
argument.

I we want to restrict the quoted expression rather than the value of an argument,
we can use `?~` :

```{r}
identity_sym_only <- ? function (x= ?~ Symbol()) {
  x
}

a <- 1
identity_sym_only(a)
identity_sym_only(a + a)

identity_sym_only
```

We see that it is translated into a `check_arg` call containing a call to `substitute`
as the first argument. The `~` is kept in the attributes of the function.

We can also check the `...`, for instance use `function(... = ? Integer())` to check
that only integers are passed to the dots, and use `function(... = ?~ Symbol())`
to check that all quoted values passed to `...` are symbols.

The special assertion factory `Dots` can also be used, in that case the checks will
apply to `list(...)` rather than to each element individually, for instance `function(... = ? Dots(2))`
makes sure the dots were fed 2 values. In a similar fashion `function(... = ?~ Dots(2))` can be
used to apply checks to the list of quoted argument passed to `...`.

## Set function return type

To set a return type we use `?` before the function definition as in the previous section, 
but we type an assertion on the left hand side.

```{r}
add_or_subtract <- Double() ? function (x, y, subtract = FALSE) {
  if(subtract) return(x - y)
  x + y
}
add_or_subtract
```

We see that the returned values have been wrapped inside `check_output` calls.

## Putting it all together, write packages using {typed}

Let's define our function for our package and document it with *{roxygen2}*.
It is documented as usual,except that you'll need to make sure to add the `@name` tag.

We declare types for the return value, for all arguments, and we declare a string `msg`.

```{r}
#' add_or_subtract
#'
#' @param x double of length 1
#' @param y double of length 1
#' @param subtract whether to subtract instead of adding
#' @export
#' @name add_or_subtract
add_or_subtract <- 
  Double(1) ? function (
    x= ? Double(1), 
    y= ? Double(1), 
    subtract = FALSE ? Logical(1, anyNA = FALSE)
    ) {
    Character(1) ? msg
    if(subtract) {
      msg <- "subtracting"
      message(msg)
      return(x - y)
    }
      msg <- "adding"
      message(msg)
    x + y
  }
```

The created function will be the following, we see that `Character(1) ? msg`
was changed into a `declare` call too, this is both for efficiency and readability.
Unfamiliar users might be intimidated by `?` and calls to `?` don't print nicely.

```{r}
add_or_subtract
```

Note that your package would import *{typed}* but `?` won't be exposed to the user,
they will see it in the code but will be able to use `?` just as before. In fact
the most common standard use `?mean` still works even when *{typed}* is attached.
